# Ordinary Differential Equation Solver (Python)

This repository contains standalone Python scripts that solve various systems of differential equations using a unified method based on my dissertation research.

## üìÇ Examples

- **Lotka-Volterra** (`lotka_volterra.py`)  
  Predator-prey model with specified initial values.

- **Van der Pol Oscillator** (`van_der_pol.py`)  
  Nonlinear oscillator dynamics.

- **Lorenz System** (`lorenz.py`)  
  Classic chaotic system.

- **Custom System** (`example4_custom_model.py`)  
  A system using initial values of your choosing.

## üß† Methodology

Each example applies a technique that reduces N-dimensional differential systems into 1D separable parts, then solves them using exponential product formulas (Lie-Trotter or Strang splitting).  
This approach is from my graduate research.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

```bash
python example1_lotka_volterra.py
